# Customer Segmentation Project
Using K-Means Clustering to Identify Customer Groups

# Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a marketing dataset. 

The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences to enable targeted marketing strategies.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data)

## Key Steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the dataset.

- Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.

- Clustering (K-Means) – Grouping customers into segments.

- Cluster Analysis – Interpreting each segment.

- Visualization – Plotting insights for better understanding.

- Conclusion - Final thoughts
